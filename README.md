# Welcome to the GitHub Repo for _The Orginal Game_

This is a game I built in 2020 during the corona virus lockdown period.
It was one of the first ever projects I built on my own after following a bunch
of Javascript and HTML5 Canvas tutorials. The project was built without any
frameworks or libraries and hence is free from any dependencies.

Feel free to fork and take or copy anythhng you want from the repo, although
you might find the code a bit messy since I wrote it a while ago when I was
oblivious of what clean code even meant :sweat_smile: .

You can also try the game out [here](https://paglobal.github.io/the-original-game).
